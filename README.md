### Project Description

A simple and interactive 2D Chess Game built using Chess.js and Chessboard.js. This project was initially planned as a 3D chess game, but we faced challenges in development, so we pivoted to a 2D version to ensure a smooth and functional experience.

 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

"To provide an immersive experience for Harry Potter fans."

 

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

"After facing challenges in developing a 3D chess game, we simplified the project to a 2D version using Chess.js and Chessboard.js. This allowed us to focus on delivering a smooth, engaging experience with a magical touch for Harry Potter fans."
